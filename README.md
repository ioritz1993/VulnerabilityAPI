## What is this tool for?<a name="what_is"></a>
VulnerabilityAPI is a rest API geared towards learning about vulnerabilities affecting modern web applications. Each vulnerability is housed in a controller that contains, on the one hand, the development in an insecure way, and on the other, solutions provided to said vulnerability, that is, the development in a safe way. Requests can be made to the different parts of the code to be able to debug and see how said vulnerability behaves. The project will grow and new vulnerabilities will be added.</br>
The vulnerabilities reported at the moment are the following:</br>
- SQL injection

## Instructions
1. Modify the connection to the database in the appsettings file. In the example: DESKTOP-7C8R4SU\\SQLEXPRESS
2. We run the script found in the Utils folder, Database.sql
3. We raise the API with visual studio and it will be ready to carry out tests

In the following talk, at the end of it, an API test is performed with the SQL injection vulnerability.</br>
